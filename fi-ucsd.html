      <h2 class="heading-19">Why create an agency?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-14">The date is December 15, 2018. I&#x27;ve just finished finals, having been a design student at UCSD for four years at this point. And I, along with countless friends, peers, and colleagues, are <strong>dissatisfied</strong>.<br><br>Allow me to paint a picture of the current state of affairs: design at UC San Diego is thriving. There&#x27;s researchers working out of the world-renowned Design Lab, initiatives working on partnering design with industry, and there&#x27;s students-- well, there&#x27;s students learning design. And that&#x27;s...it? What else are they doing?<br><br>That same December, a few friends and I took a look at the undergraduate student community in design, from ten (10) facilitated conversations between ourselves and other colleagues. Students are vastly diverse in design, ranging in interaction design, engineering, and visual media. But what are their opportunities for outputting work that&#x27;s relevant to their career pathways? There are some hubs of experience, but from our conversations we learned about their problems.</p>

        <div class="w-col w-col-10">
          <p class="paragraph-11"><strong>The classroom.</strong> Students have several opportunities to fulfill their major requirements with classes specializing in design. These classes incorporate design thinking practices, community-based projects, and web-based applications. However, a majority of conversations told us that these classes appeared to serve merely as baseline or &quot;filler&quot; for the design programs. Only 2/10 students felt confident their school work alone would help them land a career in the design industry.</p>

        <div class="w-col w-col-10">
          <p class="paragraph-11"><strong>Personal projects.</strong> Students also take on projects they feel passionate about to showcase for their potential career candidacy. These projects come with the &quot;go-getter&quot; initiative, in which students need to find their own opportunities or create their own opportunities for design work, including startup projects, case studies, and UI sketches/animations. From our conversations we learned that this is a popular method of creating relevant career work. But, for many students, it is quite a challenge to set up and sustain.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-11"><strong>Design organizations.</strong> A perceived notion from the student community has been that design organizations deliver the most value for students. There are only two student organizations <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu/community-all/student-groups/" target="_blank">recognized</a> by the Design Lab at UCSD. Conversations did tell us that these organizations provide great value for student connections and education about the design industry, but that they don&#x27;t fully prepare students for industry work + experience in the form of project work.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-24">
      <p class="paragraph-14">Looking at the ecosystem, there seems to be a huge reliance on design organizations to create opportunity for students, but not all aspects of opportunity can be targeted. From our conversations we learned that students, above all aspects of opportunity, desire industry-relevant experience to hone in on their skills, collaborate with others, and grow confidence in their roles in design.<br><br>So, how do we provide that experience to students in relation to the industry? We set out on a mission to test a model we had in mind.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-19">Putting it together</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-14">Our concept aimed to create an agency that connects students with clients within and outside the school to collaborate on projects that utilize design thinking. This agency would be empowered by students themselves who would be able to create project partnerships, mentor students involved, and expand on design opportunity at UCSD.<br><br>Except, we didn&#x27;t know how to do it right.<br><br>This hasn&#x27;t ever been done before, at least not at our school. We didn&#x27;t have any basis to found upon, so it was fundamental for us to lay out a scaffolding for the perfect team.</p>
      <h3 class="heading-20">Core team structure</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-14">With five other friends assisting in our search for problems, it was time to gear us up for contributing to the agency. We split into six roles to address duties to sustain the agency. We expanded these roles on needs for: <br><br>• <strong>mentorship</strong> for students with connections and resources, <br>• <strong>external affairs</strong> with clients and industry sponsorships,<br>• <strong>project</strong> management and task delegation,<br>• <strong>innovation</strong> on current agency practices to create new ones,<br>• <strong>marketing</strong> for publicizing the agency, <br>• and collaboration and facilitation on these duties as an overall <strong>program</strong>.<br><br>I was focused on overseeing this progress of Fi as a Program Director. Our roles would not divide us, but rather focus us, as I was able to work alongside the five directors on their respective domains.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-13"><strong>Core team.</strong> Our initial team of six were split into director roles that would serve to address specific needs and collaborations with one another.<br><br>Please share some kudos to my team!<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-zavala-4a347113b/" target="_blank">Enrique Zavala</a>, Mentorship Director<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/franklin-moirao-19469515b/" target="_blank">Franklin Moirao</a>, Innovations Director<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-alvarenga/" target="_blank">Jose Alvarenga</a>, Project Director<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nia_alexis.jpg/" target="_blank">Nia Walker</a>, Marketing Director<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam1998/" target="_blank">Samarth Aggarwal</a>, Director of External Affairs<br></p>

      </div>
      <h3 class="heading-20">Client projects</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-14">The most fundamental part of setting up this agency was creating that said opportunity for students. What was the best method of connecting students with real-world based projects? In March 2019, we facilitated conversations with four potential clients, two of which accepted to host a pilot collaboration with us.<br><br>The <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>UC San Diego Library</strong></a> connected our team with their Digital UX Librarian, who wanted to research how users access help on the library website and how a newly designed solution could contribute to the usage of the site. <br><br>A growing startup stemming from UCSD, Educational Vision Technologies (<a href="https://evt.ai/" target="_blank"><strong>EVT</strong></a>), connected with our team to gain insight on their platform from users who were new to the UI changes they created.<br><br>In both cases, we met continuously to formalize our client agreements to make sure project output would be set in stone for the students working on each project.</p>
      <h3 class="heading-20">Student recruitment</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-14">Our final and most important stepping stone of scaffolding the agency would require the participation of students themselves. The projects we formalized were specifically focused in UX research, but students were more than excited to dig into the new opportunity we created. <br><br>We recruited nine students (<em>as we like to call UX agents</em>) to participate in the program, with seven participating in the Library project and three in the EVT project. Each student has had ranging experiences in design, but all seemed to desire more relevant experience in the design industry. We had verified our hypothesis and were ready to tackle the projects by April.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-19">Current state of affairs</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-14">It&#x27;s currently June as I write this, and so far, everything has been a success or a moment of learning. Our projects have grown into continued partnerships for the summer. Our presence in the design ecosystem at UCSD has spread past the student community and has gotten the attention of the Design Lab and other design organizations. We aim to continue our growth outside of the school and create connections with industry leaders who can help provide sustainability to student opportunity.<br><br>We&#x27;ve ideated continuously on whether this agency serves as a viable concept for a business model, or even if we should fall to be adopted into the running design organization, Design @ UCSD. However, one thing has been clear for all of us: students come first, and as a higher organization we have an obligation to provide continuous opportunity and <br>support for students interested in UX and design practices.<br>‍</p><img src="images/Web-1920-–-1.jpg" srcset="images/Web-1920-–-1-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/Web-1920-–-1-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/Web-1920-–-1-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/Web-1920-–-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 81vw, (max-width: 767px) 80vw, (max-width: 991px) 76vw, 752px" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-10"><em>Our working model of interactions helps mold how our core and mentor teams empower our UX agents to create project deliverables for incoming clients.</em></p>
      <h3 class="heading-20">Looking toward the future</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-14">As I prepare to graduate, I&#x27;ve transitioned into Director of External Affairs, to focus on finding clients and industry sponsorships outside of UCSD that can assist in empowering the team&#x27;s growth. I&#x27;ve still been helping with new plans for the summer, as we plan to implement new practices for the agency in the way student agents are mentored and empowered.<br><br>Within 2.5 months of fully pursuing this agency&#x27;s goals, I can&#x27;t stress enough how life-changing this experience has been. People have told me I was crazy for even thinking to start such a thing, but the thing is alive and it is a continued mission of mine to make sure that this agency not only becomes a legacy of mine at UCSD, but also provides life-changing experiences to students who excel through the projects.</p>
