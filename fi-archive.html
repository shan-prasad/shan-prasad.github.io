      <h3>Yes, a student-run UX agency.</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-7">At UC San Diego I&#x27;ve witnessed countless scholars engage in internships, cutting-edge research, and entrepreneurship &amp; innovation. But there is a recurring theme at the campus when it comes to another countless set of students interested in UX/UI design or anything revolving around it. These students interested in HCD don&#x27;t know or have confidence to apply the principles they&#x27;ve learned outside the classroom.<br><br><strong>It is a fundamental challenge</strong> to take ideal and theoretical learning in design, and directly apply it to work in industry, organizational, and clientele work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container-12 w-container">
      <h3>What did we do about it?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-6">I noticed this problem as I faced rejections from multiple companies for UX and product design positions. Talking with others who were rejected revealed interesting insights about how class and extracurricular projects and UX case studies <em class="italic-text-2">don&#x27;t really cut it when it comes to working in the real world</em>.<br><br>I concluded that students needed an opportunity to hone in on their abilities and excel in real projects that deliver real impact to the world, to understand their implications and expand on their skillsets.<br></p>
      <blockquote class="block-quote-2"><strong><em>February 2019</em></strong><em>: I pulled together five (5) close friends to ideate on a solution to approach this. What was created was a concept: to bring together a website to build rapport for a student-run design agency.</em></blockquote>

      <h3>Setting up a team</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-6">Post-marketing, we were astonished with feedback from the community: there was a massive rally for support for this type of group on campus, student-run startups and campus organizations were reaching out to us to collaborate, and people were suddenly starting to rave about a group of UXers on campus that didn&#x27;t yet exist.<br><br>We were also concerned with how we were going to create projects for the several students that had applied. There were an abundance of small organizations that wanted to work with us, but as we had put our vision in sync on this project, we wanted to approach projects that we would be delivering impact to.</p>
      <blockquote class="block-quote-2"><strong><em>March 2019</em></strong><em>: Our team finalized partnerships for projects with two (2) high-profile clients. Our team also welcomed in ten (10) students in as UX agents for our team.</em></blockquote>

      <h3>Structuring the agency</h3>
      <blockquote class="block-quote-2"><strong><em>April 2019</em></strong><em>: Our kickoff meeting brought in our new students, clientele, and mentors all into one space.</em></blockquote>
      <p class="paragraph-6">And it was from this meeting we learned this group needed a lot of work.<br><br>Almost everything seemed in chaos: students weren&#x27;t 100% confident in their ability to deliver, our clients were confused about our approach to these projects, and our core team was scrambling in several duties to make everything go smoothly.<br><br>What we needed was a structure for our team&#x27;s members to flow through, and structure for our interactions within the team and externally to clients and mentors.</p>

      <h3>Program design of Fi</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-6"><strong>If you made it this far, you&#x27;re getting closer to the juice of this agency.</strong><br><br>I say program design because of the effect this agency has not on clients but on students: providing them with a gateway into UX (regardless of experience) to learn and apply to real projects. Replace the word agency with program, and you have something students need for success. Read more on our inspiration from <a href="https://www.unitedwaygt.org/document.doc?id=538" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>Being able to work in a team setting was just as important as making sure that the structure we set forth will be sustainable in the long run for new students and a new core team. We worked with many models from design groups at UCSD, such as Design @ UCSD, Design for America, Product Space, Design Leap, re:make, all whom have had experience with this organization in project work and were more than happy to collaborate with us in sharing their structure.</p>
      <div class="columns-4 w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-4">
          <p>We were most inspired by this educational structure, as it connects an entire school with experts and an agency of students to excel in a working environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-8 w-col w-col-8"><img src="images/image.png" srcset="images/image-p-500.png 500w, images/image-p-800.png 800w, images/image-p-1080.png 1080w, images/image-p-1600.png 1600w, images/image-p-2000.png 2000w, images/image.png 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 72vw, 46vw" alt=""></div>

      <div class="columns-4 w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-4">
          <p>We put together this structure as a method of including core team, mentors, and clients into the loop with our UX agent teams.<br><br>Two of the &quot;love triangles&quot; within our internal team to notice are between our mentor group and our clientele. Both groups have a synchronous communication line between our entire team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-8 w-col w-col-8"><img src="images/Web-1920-–-1.jpg" srcset="images/Web-1920-–-1-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/Web-1920-–-1-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/Web-1920-–-1-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/Web-1920-–-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 72vw, 46vw" alt=""></div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph-6">We also were tasked with figuring out our core team. We put together a short list of all the things we needed for sustainability and growth of the agency, and created a core team of <strong>directors</strong>. Each director was a specialist in a certain aspect of the overall program.<br><br><strong>Project Director</strong>: oversees project deliverable progress and supervises over UX agents to meet deadlines<br><strong>Innovations Director</strong>: researches new ways to develop better relationships internally and externally, responsible for executing on those organizational changes<br><strong>Marketing Director</strong>: collaborates with agent team for marketing needs, outreaches to community for user participants, updates community on Fi team progress and events<br><strong>Mentorship Director</strong>: oversees mentoring points for each project, outreaches to design faculty and community leaders for mentorship support<br><strong>Director of External Affairs</strong>: outreaches to future clients and sponsorships to propel growth from external parties, provides framework for external agency to act like a startup<br><strong>Program Director</strong>: acts as principal director, collaborates with other directors on ensuring sustainability for director tasks, oversees progress made by all directors <strong><em>(that&#x27;s me!)</em></strong></p>

      <blockquote class="block-quote-2"><strong><em>May 2019</em></strong><em>: Both teams are working toward their deliverable presentations and reports.</em></blockquote>
      <p class="paragraph-6">The structure thus far has helped our students connect with the problem at hand much more quickly than in a classroom setting. We still need to include students in internal interviews to determine their satisfaction with the work in these projects.<br><br>If you&#x27;d like to learn more about the Library project design process, please visit here.<br><br>As we conclude our project deliverables, I&#x27;ve transitioned into emphasizing management on external affairs in finding a client outside of UCSD. We desire this client to be able to collaborate with students and serve as a sponsor to the group&#x27;s initiatives through funding and allocation of resources.<br><br>We&#x27;re working to set our positions up for students to take over and uphold our value proposition after we&#x27;ve graduated from the school. I intend on serving as an advisor to the next set of directors to make sure that they are able to work flawlessly and with brighter goals in innovation.<br>‍</p>
